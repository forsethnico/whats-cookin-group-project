## Introduction
'Anyone Can Cook!' is an interactive website similar to Epicurious, AllRecipes, or NYTimes cooking. A user can browse recipes and save their favorites for later. Users can browse recipes by tag (course) or search for recipes by name. If a photo or name catches their eye, they can click on the recipe to see more details about the recipe such as ingredients, amounts, estimated cost to make, and step by step instructions. On the recipe page, they even have the option to add it to their Favorites aka future list of recipes to cook! The user can also search on their Favorites page by recipe name or by tags as well.

## Set Up
1. This project fetches data from an API so you will need to begin by cloning down the API and running it.
2. Clone the API by running `git clone (add link here)`
3. CD into that directory, run npm install and then npm start. You should see ‚ÄúWhat's cookin-starter-kit API is now running on http://localhost:3001 !‚Äù
4. Open a NEW terminal tab and cd somewhere outside of the API repo you just cloned. Do not close the tab that is running the API.
5. Clone a copy of this repo to your machine by running git clone `https://github.com/tfettig22/whats-cookin-group-project`
6. CD into the directory
7. Run `npm install`
8. Run `npm start`
9. A link will appear in the terminal similar to http://localhost:8080/ (you might see 8081). Open that link in your browser. `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server. 
10. Enjoy!

## Features
- User can view all recipes on the main page and use the Search bar to filter by name or by tags (course) such as "snack" or "dinner." There are several ways to view more recipe info. The recipe images and a main recipe image on the main page as well as the links on the right side will all take you to that recipe:
